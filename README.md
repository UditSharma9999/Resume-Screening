# Resume Screening/Scanning <br/> 
Writing a resume is not a trivial task, especially when it comes to the right selection of keywords. <br/>
People spend hours writing and formatting the perfect resume. <br/>

**Artificial Intelligence**<br/>
Artificial intelligence, along with text mining and natural language processing algorithms, can be applied for the development of programs. <br/>
These programs usually look for specific keywords; they sort resumes and rank them to determine the job applications . <br/>


**About Dataset** <br/>
Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates. <br/>

Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is 
labour-intensive, growing, and facing high attrition rates. <br/>

IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain 
expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume 
Screening. <br/>

Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.
